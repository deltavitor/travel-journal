# Travel journal

This is a project I created while taking a React Course on [Scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/). The design wasn't made by me, I simply created the project and wrote the code on my own as an exercise. The Figma file with the design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/WlyaBrf8wOG81DPEMflgaX/Travel-Journal-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1).

Also, with this project I learned a few things about setting up a production environment and actually deploying the project, which was very exciting. [Click here](https://deltavitor.github.io/travel-journal) to take a look at the Travel Journal, hosted with GitHub Pages.
